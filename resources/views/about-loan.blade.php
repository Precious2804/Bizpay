                            <h3>Repayment</h3>
                            <p>Repayment of all credit facilities shall be in the sum and manner stipulated in the repayment schedule issued upon acceptance of the terms and conditions but not later than 35 days from the effective date of this agreement.  PROVIDED THAT Bizpay Global Limited may, upon a 7-day notice to the customer review the manner and term(s) of repayment. You have a grace of 35 days to safely pay back the overdraft and accumulated interest entirely. If you still have an outstanding repayment after you took the overdraft, we have your permission to report you to your bank or the credit bureau and you may never be able to take a loan from any financial institution in your country again. </p>

                            <p>We also have your permission to send professional debt collectors to recover the loan from you personally, which isn't something we'd like to do but extreme circumstances call for extreme measures.

                            <p>loan repayments and interest shall be deducted automatically on your due date of withdrawal and your remaining earnings goes into your local bank account.</p>
